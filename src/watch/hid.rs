//! Direct raw-HID transport to ZSA keyboards.
//!
//! Speaks the "Oryx WebHID" protocol shipped in `zsa/qmk_modules` — same
//! wire format the ZSA keyboard firmware speaks — over QMK's raw HID channel (usage page
//! `0xFF60`, usage `0x61`). No daemon, no "enable API in Settings":
//! plug the keyboard in and open `/dev/hidraw*` directly via the
//! kernel-claimed HID interface.
//!
//! Phase 2 scope: read path from Phase 1 plus a bidirectional command
//! queue — host→device writes for layer locking, RGB, status LEDs, and
//! brightness. Commands are enqueued via [`CommandSender`]; the blocking
//! pump drains pending commands between reads, so writes never race the
//! `hidapi` read handle (which is not `Sync`). Device state mutation
//! remains authoritative — the UI observes firmware LAYER events rather
//! than updating optimistically.
//!
//! ## Wire format
//!
//! Every packet is 32 bytes. `bytes[0]` is the command / event id;
//! payload follows; padded with `0xFE` to 32 bytes. The firmware treats
//! `0xFE` as both the stop byte and the neutral padding byte. Because
//! of that, a fully-padded all-`0xFE` packet means "no command, please
//! return the protocol version" — and the `GET_PROTOCOL_VERSION`
//! command id is therefore defined as `0xFE` itself.
//!
//! ## Session flow
//!
//! 1. Enumerate HID devices with VID `0x3297` + usage page `0xFF60` /
//!    usage `0x61`. First match wins (multi-device selection: Phase 2+).
//! 2. Open the device.
//! 3. `GET_PROTOCOL_VERSION` → expect `0x04`. Warn on drift below 0x04;
//!    hard-fail on anything above (unknown newer dialect).
//! 4. `PAIRING_INIT` → read until `PAIRING_SUCCESS`. In firmware25 the
//!    success event is immediate.
//! 5. `GET_FW_VERSION` → stash the version string.
//! 6. Event loop: drain any queued [`Command`]s, then `read_timeout(32)`
//!    and dispatch by `bytes[0]`.
//!
//! ## Host-side sustain
//!
//! The firmware holds an RGB / status-LED override indefinitely until
//! the host explicitly hands control back via `RGB_CONTROL(0)` /
//! `STATUS_LED_CONTROL(0)`. To match Keymapp's "timed effect" UX we
//! implement sustain on the host side: a non-zero `sustain` on an RGB
//! or status command spawns a timer task that enqueues the matching
//! release command when it fires. A newer sustained command cancels
//! the prior timer (newer call wins).
