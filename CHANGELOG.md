## [Unreleased]

### Added — ZSA Moonlander support

The Moonlander Mark I is now a first-class geometry alongside the
Voyager: `oryx-bench init --geometry moonlander` (both Oryx and local
modes), and the full command surface — `pull`, `show`, `explain`,
`find`, `lint`, `diff`, `build`, `flash`, `watch` — works against a
Moonlander project.

- `src/schema/geometry/moonlander.rs` — 72-key `Geometry`
  implementation: position vocabulary (7 columns per half incl. the
  `innermost` split-gap column, `mod` row, `thumb_big` + three
  `thumb_piano_*` keys per cluster), electrical-matrix map, QMK
  `LAYOUT_moonlander` argument permutation, ASCII grid, and
  pixel-accurate physical layout with rotated thumb clusters. The
  canonical (Oryx `keys[]`) ↔ QMK argument correspondence was derived
  by cross-matching the pinned ZSA fork's Oryx-exported
  `keymaps/oryx/keymap.c` against the same layout pulled from the Oryx
  GraphQL endpoint, since the Moonlander's `keyboard.json` carries no
  `label` fields.
- `GeometryName::Moonlander` typed enum variant (previously parsed as
  the forward-compat `Other` catch-all).
- `examples/moonlander-default/` — the stock "Moonlander Default
  Layout" pulled from Oryx as a committed fixture, wired into the
  codegen structural round-trip test, the `qmk c2json` integration
  check, and three new render snapshots.

### Fixed — Docker build backend hardcoded the Voyager

`src/build/docker.rs` mounted the staged keymap at
`keyboards/zsa/voyager/...`, compiled `-kb zsa/voyager`, and looked for
`zsa_voyager_oryx-bench.bin` regardless of the project's configured
geometry — a leaky abstraction the `Geometry::qmk_keyboard()` method
existed to prevent. The build backend now resolves all three from the
project's geometry, so `oryx-bench build` compiles the right board's
firmware for any registered geometry.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-04-15

### Changed — nix build migrated to crane

`flake.nix` now builds `oryx-bench` via [crane](https://github.com/ipetkov/crane)
instead of `rustPlatform.buildRustPackage`. Cold builds are comparable;
incremental rebuilds after a source change drop from ~10 minutes to seconds
because crane caches the dependency graph in a separate nix derivation
keyed on `Cargo.lock` + toolchain, so only the workspace crate recompiles
when application code changes.

Source filter switched from `craneLib.cleanCargoSource` (rust-only, strips
`skills/`, `packaging/docker/`, `examples/`) to `pkgs.nix-gitignore.gitignoreSource`
so assets referenced by `include_str!` ride along while `target/` and other
gitignored dirs stay out of the store copy. This also fixes the slow
store ingest observed on dirty path-flake inputs (full tree copied
instead of gitignore-aware).

- `flake.nix` — crane input + `commonArgs` / `cargoArtifacts` split;
  `guiLibs` collected in one place for `buildInputs`, `postFixup`
  rpath, and the devShell hook (single source of truth).
- `flake.lock` — records new `crane` input.

No CLI, runtime, or API change. Distro users see identical binaries.

### Fixed — `zapp flash` rejected v0.2.0 firmware (no DFU suffix)

`oryx-bench flash` failed at the zapp loader with `Invalid firmware:
not a valid firmware file (no DFU suffix or Intel HEX header found)`
for every .bin produced by v0.2.0. Root cause: `src/generate/rules_mk.rs`
emitted `DFU_SUFFIX_ARGS =` (empty), overriding the Voyager upstream
default and producing raw .bin without the suffix zapp's loader
requires. The earlier assumption that zapp identified devices purely
at the USB protocol level and ignored the suffix was wrong — it
requires a DFU suffix for STM32 .bin or an Intel HEX header for
HALFKAY.

- `src/generate/rules_mk.rs` — removed the `DFU_SUFFIX_ARGS =`
  override so QMK's upstream Voyager default (correct vendor/product
  IDs) stamps the suffix during compile.
- `packaging/docker/Dockerfile` — restored `dfu-util` (provides
  `dfu-suffix`, required by QMK's build step).
- `docs/v0.2-flash-issues.md` — corrected the section on zapp's
  suffix handling; documented the incident.

Users on v0.2.0 must rebuild firmware (`oryx-bench build`) before
flashing.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-14

### Changed — flash pipeline delegates to ZSA's `zapp`

`oryx-bench flash` now shells out to the official
[`zapp`](https://github.com/zsa/zapp) CLI (>=1.0.0, required on PATH)
instead of invoking `wally-cli`, `dfu-util`, or the Keymapp GUI
handoff directly. `zapp` owns the USB DFU and HALFKAY protocols
natively via libusb and supports every ZSA board, so a single handoff
replaces three in-tree backends.

This resolves `docs/v0.2-flash-issues.md` items #1–#4 (wally-cli
Voyager incompatibility, DFU suffix byte-order bug, board-unaware
backend detection, undocumented udev rules) and reaffirms the
`ARCHITECTURE.md` non-goal that oryx-bench never invokes `dfu-util`
directly.

**Breaking (surfaces):**
- `--backend` values collapse from `{auto, dfu-util, wally, keymapp}`
  to `{auto, zapp}`. Existing scripts using `--backend wally` or
  `--backend keymapp` must drop the flag (or pass `--backend zapp`).
- `Geometry::dfu_params()`, the `DfuParams` struct, and the
  `STM32_DFU_VENDOR` constant are removed — DFU parameters live in
  `zapp` now (single source of truth for flash protocols).
- `oryx-bench setup` reports `zapp` in place of `wally-cli`. Keymapp
  is intentionally not detected by `setup` / `status` — it is not
  required by any `oryx-bench` command (users who want Keymapp as a
  GUI or recovery path install it separately).

**Code:**
- `src/flash/zapp.rs` — new backend; checks `zapp --version >= 1.0.0`
  before invoking `zapp flash <firmware.bin>` with inherited stdio.
- `src/flash/mod.rs` — single `Backend::Zapp`, single `detect_backend`
  surface, stripped board-aware branching.
- `src/flash/{wally,dfu_util,keymapp}.rs` — removed.
- `src/schema/geometry/{mod,voyager}.rs` — removed DFU params.
- `src/commands/flash.rs` — `--dry-run` no longer requires `zapp` on
  PATH (describes the plan even on hosts without the flasher
  installed; hardware flash still checks).
- `src/generate/rules_mk.rs` — still disables `DFU_SUFFIX_ARGS`
  (comment updated: suffix is dead weight under zapp, and disabling
  it drops a host-side build dep).

**Docs:** `README.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/v0.2-flash-issues.md`,
`skills/oryx-bench/reference/{workflows,command-reference}.md`, and
`packaging/nix/README.md` updated to reference `zapp` as the flash
surface. `cargo xtask gen-skill-docs` regenerated.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-04-13

### Fixed (production-blocker: live Oryx GraphQL `combos` schema mismatch — task #66)

Discovered during P2.3 testing: any real `oryx-bench pull` against
`oryx.zsa.io` was failing because the live 2026-Q2 Oryx schema
changed `combos` from a scalar to an object type requiring a
sub-selection. Our `FULL_QUERY` requested bare `combos`, the server
responded with `Field must have selections (field 'combos' returns
Combo but has no selections)`, and the entire pull pipeline halted.
**v0.1 could not ship until this was fixed.**

A worktree-isolated investigation agent introspected the live
schema and confirmed the new `Combo` shape:

```graphql
Combo { keyIndices: [Int!]!, layerIdx: Int!, name: String!, trigger: Json! }
```

Spot-checked `Layout` and `Revision` for further drift; only
`combos` had changed. Every other field we currently select still
exists.

**Schema:**
- `src/pull/graphql.rs::FULL_QUERY` — `combos` line replaced with a sub-selection requesting `keyIndices`, `layerIdx`, and `trigger`. `name` is deliberately omitted: no downstream consumer reads it. Each field has an inline comment naming the consumer that needs it (single source of truth: adding a new field to the query requires a corresponding use site).
- `src/schema/oryx.rs::Combo` — promoted from a thin `serde_json::Value` to a typed struct with `key_indices: Vec<u8>`, `layer_idx: u8`, `trigger: serde_json::Value`, plus the existing `extra` round-trip bag. All fields are required (no `serde(default)`) so a missing field produces a loud parse error rather than a silent empty chord.
- `src/schema/oryx.rs::Revision::combos` — changed from `Vec<Combo>` to `Option<Vec<Combo>>`. The live server returns `combos: null` (not `[]`) for combo-less layouts, and `#[serde(default)] Vec<Combo>` does NOT accept JSON `null`. The canonical converter normalizes `None` → empty list.
- `src/schema/canonical.rs::oryx_combo_to_canonical` — rewritten to project a typed `Combo` into `CanonicalCombo`. Resolves `key_indices` to position-name strings via `Geometry::index_to_position`, looks up `layer_idx` against the revision's layer table, and runs `trigger` through `oryx_action_to_canonical` (single source of truth for keycode translation: the same function key actions go through). Every step propagates errors with context — out-of-range key index, unknown layer, malformed trigger — rather than silently dropping a combo.

**Fixture:** `examples/voyager-dvorak/pulled/revision.json` previously omitted `combos` entirely. Added a single combo (indices 16/17 chord on layer 0 emitting `KC_ESCAPE`) so the existing wiremock + canonical tests exercise the new shape automatically.

**New test:** `tests/pull_mock.rs::pull_now_round_trips_object_typed_combos` builds a minimal-but-realistic full-layout response inline (independent of the example fixture's evolution), mounts it on wiremock, runs `pull::pull_now`, then asserts the combo round-trips end-to-end:
1. `oryx::Layout` deserializes `key_indices: [16, 17]` and `layer_idx: 0`
2. `CanonicalLayout::from_oryx` produces exactly one combo
3. Indices 16/17 → `["L_index_home", "L_inner_home"]` via the Voyager geometry
4. `layer_idx: 0` → `Some("Main")`
5. `trigger: { code: "KC_ESCAPE" }` → `sends: "KC_ESC"`

This pins both the wire format AND the geometry/layer/action translation paths so a future Oryx schema change to any of those paths fires before it ships to production.

### Fixed (`layerIdx` semantic ambiguity — investigation + hardening — task #70)

After #66 landed, a focused investigation agent probed the live Oryx
endpoint to resolve a follow-on semantic question: the schema models
`Combo.layerIdx` as a non-null `Int!` without documenting whether it
means **(A)** the 0-based array index into `revision.layers[]` as
serialized, or **(B)** the layer's `position` field value. Our
`oryx_combo_to_canonical` initially committed to interpretation B
(`find(|(p, _)| *p == c.layer_idx)`).

The investigation sampled multiple public Voyager layouts with
non-empty combos (`z4A0O`, `XgYB9`, `alBEv`, others — including the
11-layer `alBEv` with 14 combos referencing `layerIdx` up to 2).
**Every public layout had `layers[i].position == i`**, making
interpretations A and B observationally equivalent in practice. The
verdict was UNRESOLVABLE from public data alone, but with strong
corroborating evidence that Oryx normalizes `layers[]` to be
position-sorted on serialization.

To stay correct under either interpretation AND to detect a future
schema divergence the moment it appears, `oryx_combo_to_canonical`
now resolves `layerIdx` against **both** views via a new
`resolve_combo_layer` helper with this decision matrix:

| `by_position` | `by_array_idx` | Result                                          |
|---------------|----------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `Some(p)`     | `Some(a)` p==a | `Ok(p)` — typical case, both interpretations agree |
| `Some(p)`     | `Some(a)` p!=a | **`Err`** — schema divergence; refuse to guess  |
| `Some(p)`     | `None`         | `Ok(p)` — only `position` matches               |
| `None`        | `Some(a)`      | `Ok(a)` + `tracing::warn!` — fallback fired     |
| `None`        | `None`         | `Err` — combo points at nothing                 |

The disagreement branch is the load-bearing one: the moment Oryx
ships a layout where `layers[i].position != i` AND the difference
matters for some combo's `layerIdx`, the build fails with a precise
error citing both candidate layer names — the user files an issue
rather than silently flashing a combo on the wrong layer. The
fallback branch logs a warning so a less-severe divergence (only
array-index works) is also visible without breaking the build.

5 new unit tests pin every branch of the decision matrix:
- `resolve_combo_layer_typical_case_position_eq_array_index` — both agree
- `resolve_combo_layer_disagreement_errors_loudly` — different layer names
- `resolve_combo_layer_only_position_matches` — uses position
- `resolve_combo_layer_only_array_index_matches` — fallback + warn
- `resolve_combo_layer_neither_matches_errors` — "matches neither" error

### Fixed (Phase 2 second post-review pass — 14 reviewer findings)

After the first post-review pass landed, a second strict reviewer
agent ran against P2.5–P2.9 plus the first post-review's own work.
Returned NEEDS FIXES with 4 critical bugs, 5 important gaps, and 5
nits. All 14 fixed in 4 batches.

**Critical correctness bugs:**
- **`escape_c_string` `\xNN` greediness.** C's `\x` escape is greedy and consumes any following hex digits without bound, so `"\x07A"` would parse as one character with value `0x7A`, silently dropping the BEL we meant to escape. Fixed by emitting `\xNN""` (the trailing empty string concatenates at C translation phase 6 per ISO C99 6.4.4.4 ¶7 and breaks the hex run, while leaving the resulting string identical at runtime). 3 new regression tests cover the bug, including the hex-letter-after-control-char case that the original test missed.
- **`CanonicalAction::Custom(u8)` had no upper bound.** `u8` allowed 0..255 but QMK only declares `USER00..USER31` (32 slots) in `keycodes.h`. A `Custom(42)` reaching codegen would emit `USER42` which would fail to link with a confusing `arm-none-eabi-ld: undefined reference` deep inside the QMK build. New `MAX_USER_KEYCODE_SLOT = 31` const enforced by both parsers (`oryx_action_to_canonical` and `schema::layout::parse_action`) — out-of-range values fall through to `Keycode::Other` so the `unknown-keycode` lint catches them at the user's first lint run instead of producing a silent codegen drop or a broken QMK build. Codegen also defends with a loud error if a `Custom(n > 31)` somehow reaches it (defense in depth). 5 new tests cover both parsers and the codegen error path.
- **`extract_user_tokens` missing trailing-boundary check.** The scanner extracted `USER01` from `USER1USER2` (one identifier in C/Zig) and `USER05` from `USER05suffix`. Fixed with a right-boundary check (`!is_ident_byte(bytes[j])`) symmetric to the existing left-boundary check on `MY_USER00`. The loop bound `<` was also corrected to `<=` so a file ending in exactly `USER05` (no trailing whitespace) is still scanned. 5 new regression tests pin both the rejected-concatenation cases AND the now-working short-file case.
- **`commands/detach.rs` data loss + silenced rollback failure.** `detach` called `atomic_write(&target, ...)` unconditionally, silently destroying any pre-existing user-authored `layout.toml` (for example, a draft for a future detach, or a reference layout). The rollback path `let _ = remove_file(&target)` also swallowed errors entirely, so the user got no signal if cleanup failed. Fixed: `detach` now bails *before* writing if `target.exists()` (refuses to clobber); the rollback path uses `eprintln!` to surface its own failures. New `tests/attach_detach.rs::detach_refuses_to_clobber_existing_layout_toml` integration test pins the new behavior.

**Important gaps:**
- **`WARNING_HEADROOM_BYTES = 4 KB` doesn't scale across board sizes.** On a hypothetical 16 MB future board the rule would fire only at 99.97% — way too late to be useful. Replaced with `max(WARNING_HEADROOM_FLOOR_BYTES = 4 KB, budget / WARNING_HEADROOM_DIVISOR = 16)` so the warning fires at ~93.75% on small boards (Voyager: 64 KB → 4 KB headroom) AND large boards (16 MB → 1 MB headroom). Comments document why each constant was chosen.
- **`KbToml::validate()` only checked sync rate limits.** Now also validates `layout.geometry` against `geometry::is_known()` (typos surface immediately at `Project::load_at` time with the supported list) AND the mode mutex (`hash_id` xor `[layout.local]` — both-set or neither-set are rejected). Without these guards, a typo in `geometry = "voyger"` propagated to the first command that called `geometry::get(...)`, producing a different error message at every call site (`build`, `flash`, `lint`, `show`, `find`, `explain`). 4 new tests pin each branch.
- **`init` template round-trip tests were tautological.** They asserted `parsed.build.backend == BuildBackend::default()`, which would still hold if a future PR changed both the default AND the rendered template — defeating the regression-protection goal. Replaced with literal-variant assertions (`BuildBackend::Docker`, `AutoPull::OnRead`) AND raw-string assertions on the rendered TOML (`raw.contains(r#"backend = "docker""#)`, etc.). A future change that drops the line entirely or changes the value now fails the test loudly.
- **`commands/diff.rs::git_show` collapsed three failure modes** ("ref doesn't exist", "object doesn't exist at ref", "git internal error") into `Ok(None)`. A user typo like `oryx-bench diff HAED` would silently show "no changes" instead of "unknown revision". Fixed by adding `git rev-parse --verify <ref>^{commit}` as a step-1 ref-validity probe (locale-independent exit code) and `git cat-file -t` as a type check (so a path pointing at a directory doesn't get parsed as TOML). Three distinct failure modes now produce three distinct user-facing errors.
- **`flash::project_geometry` half-done dedup.** The helper was added in the first post-review pass but only used in `run`; `check_firmware_is_fresh` still re-implemented the same registry-lookup boilerplate. Now both call sites route through the helper.

**Nits cleaned up:**
- `extract_user_tokens` loop bound `< → <=` (covered above as part of the boundary fix).
- `Environment` trait generalized from `wally_on_path()` to `binary_on_path(&str)` so adding a future probe (e.g. `dfu-util` for an alternate backend) doesn't grow the trait. `StubEnv` fixture now uses `HashSet<&'static str>` and a `with_wally(bool)` constructor for ergonomics.
- `render_toml_value` String escaping: extracted `escape_c_config_string` helper so a user-supplied `[config] manufacturer = "My \"Cool\" Co"` produces a properly-escaped `#define MANUFACTURER "My \"Cool\" Co"` instead of malformed C (or worse, injected preprocessor tokens). 2 new tests, including the same `\xNN""` boundary discipline as the SEND_STRING escaper.
- `BACKOFF_SHIFT_CAP = 6` const + `const _: () = assert!(MAX_ATTEMPTS - 1 <= BACKOFF_SHIFT_CAP)` — a future `MAX_ATTEMPTS` bump trips the assertion at compile time instead of silently flatlining backoff at `2^6 * BACKOFF_BASE`.
- `unused_feature_flag::flag_is_unused` docstring now explicitly documents the "unknown flag silently accepted" gap as intentional, with a pointer to a future `unknown-feature-flag` lint that would close it.

**Test count: 262** (started at 169 pre-Phase-2; +93 across all Phase 2 work and three review passes). Clippy clean. Fmt clean. `cargo test --workspace` green from a fresh checkout.

### Fixed (Phase 2 post-review pass — 22 reviewer findings)

After Phase 2 landed, a strict reviewer agent ran against P2.1–P2.4
and surfaced 22 follow-on items: 2 critical correctness bugs, 12
"important" gaps (4 of which were missing-test-coverage on
critical-path code), and 8 nits. Fixed all 22 in 5 batches with
`cargo test` between batches.

**Critical correctness bugs:**
- **Mid-response IO errors no longer bypass the retry loop.** Previously, a TCP reset / TLS truncation / gzip EOF *after* `send()` succeeded but *during* `read_to_end` would propagate via `?` directly out of the retry loop, breaking the "bounded retry on transient failures" claim. Restructured `read_capped_body` to return a typed `BodyReadError::{Io, TooLarge, NotUtf8}` so `do_post` can reclassify mid-stream IO errors as `PostAttempt::Retriable`, while still treating "too large" and "not UTF-8" as hard failures (where retry can't help).
- **`tt_too_short` description vs code semantic mismatch.** Description said "at or below the disambiguation threshold" but code used strict `<`. A user with `tapping_term_ms = 150` would read the description, expect the rule to fire, and get silence. Description rewritten to "strictly below the 150ms disambiguation minimum"; the comment in `fix_example` now explicitly explains why 180ms is the recommendation (margin of safety above the 150ms minimum) so the apparent inconsistency between threshold and recommendation is documented.

**Important gaps:**
- **`parse_retry_after` no longer silently swallows garbage.** Previously, any unparseable header value (HTTP-date form, "garbage-from-a-load-balancer", random whitespace) returned `Some(Duration::from_secs(5))`, treating junk as a valid "wait 5s" signal. Now returns `None` for anything that isn't a delta-seconds integer, letting the caller fall back to its own backoff schedule. Adding a real HTTP-date parser is left for if Oryx ever actually emits HTTP-date Retry-After values.
- **`Retry-After: 0` no longer creates a hot retry loop.** `do_post` now clamps the parsed value to `BACKOFF_BASE.max(...)` so a misbehaving server sending `Retry-After: 0` waits at least 200ms between attempts. Combined with `MAX_ATTEMPTS = 3`, the worst case is bounded.
- **Backoff jitter is now actually random.** Previously used `SystemTime::now().subsec_nanos() % base_ms` which produced clock-correlated values across NTP-synced hosts (same wallclock → same modulo result, undermining the anti-thundering-herd guarantee). Now uses `rand::thread_rng().gen_range(0..base_ms)`, which on first use seeds itself from the OS RNG. Added `rand = "0.8"` as a direct dep.
- **`do_post`'s 500-not-retried branch documented.** A 5-line comment explains *why* 500 is excluded from the 502/503/504 retry list (Oryx 500s are real server-side bugs that the next retry will hit again; 500 should fail fast and surface as a data error). Pinned by the existing `pull_now_surfaces_http_500` test.
- **`warn_if_stale_s = 0` and `poll_interval_s = 0` rejected at config-load time.** New `KbToml::validate()` method called from `Project::load_at`. Previously `warn_if_stale_s = 0` would make the `not-pulled-recently` lint fire on every single run with no documented "0 = disabled" semantic; `poll_interval_s = 0` would let auto-pull hammer Oryx with no rate limit. Both error with a user-actionable message explaining what to set instead. 3 new unit tests pin the validation.
- **`large_firmware` rule no longer silent on unknown geometry.** Previously a no-op when `geometry::get(...)` returned `None`. Now surfaces a `Severity::Info` issue ("skipped: cannot determine flash budget for unknown geometry '{name}'") so the user can tell why the rule didn't run.
- **`large_firmware` threshold now `WARNING_HEADROOM_BYTES = 4 KB`** instead of `WARNING_THRESHOLD_FRACTION = 0.9375`. Encoded as an absolute byte headroom rather than a fraction so the warning point doesn't silently drift if a future board's flash size isn't a multiple of 64 KB.
- **`flash`/`init` error messages list supported geometries from the registry.** New `geometry::supported_slugs()` helper projects the `REGISTRY` into a sorted comma-separated string. Used in `init`, `flash::run`, and `flash::check_firmware_is_fresh` so the list of valid geometries lives in exactly one place — adding a new board no longer requires editing three error message strings.
- **`flash::project_geometry` helper extracts the registry-lookup boilerplate** out of `run` and `check_firmware_is_fresh`, eliminating the duplication the reviewer flagged.
- **Critical-path test coverage gaps closed:**
  - `pull_now_rejects_oversized_response_body` — wiremock returns a 6 MB body, asserts the `ResponseTooLarge` error path. Pins the 5 MB cap end-to-end.
  - `pull_now_honors_retry_after_then_succeeds` — wiremock returns 429 with `Retry-After: 1`, then 200 on the next attempt; asserts the happy path.
  - `read_cache_treats_corrupt_file_as_default_with_warning` and `read_cache_missing_file_is_silent_default` — pin both branches of the P2.1 corruption-vs-not-found distinction.
  - `local_revision_hash_propagates_parse_error` and `local_revision_hash_missing_file_is_ok_none` — pin the P2.1 Result-returning behavior so a future refactor back to `.ok()?` is caught by CI.
  - `init_oryx_mode_template_round_trips_through_kb_toml_with_typed_defaults` and `init_local_mode_template_round_trips_with_never_auto_pull` — write the init template, parse it back through `KbToml`, and assert each typed default field matches. Future changes to `AutoPull::default()` or `BuildBackend::default()` that don't propagate into the template will fail this test instead of silently shipping the wrong config.
- **`flash::detect_backend` now testable via `Environment` trait.** New `Environment::wally_on_path()` abstracts the `which::which` probe; `RealEnvironment` is the production impl, and tests pass a `StubEnv { wally_present: bool }` to cover the wally-not-installed path that was untestable before. 4 new unit tests cover all 4 BackendChoice variants × wally-present/absent.

**Nits cleaned up:**
- `tt_too_short` `fix_example` adds a `// Recommended is intentionally HIGHER than the 150ms threshold...` comment tying the 180ms minimum recommendation to the 200–220ms sweet spot.
- `serde_json::from_str` for the GraphQL response body now has `.context("parsing Oryx GraphQL response body as JSON")` so the error chain says where the parse failed.
- `util::http::USER_AGENT` is now a `const &'static str` via `concat!("oryx-bench/", env!("CARGO_PKG_VERSION"))` — compile-time evaluated, no allocation. Replaces the `format!()`-in-OnceCell pattern.
- `WARNING_HEADROOM_BYTES` (4 KB) replaces `WARNING_THRESHOLD_FRACTION` in `large_firmware` (see above).
- `AutoPull` schema now uses bare `#[serde(default)]` (relying on the `Default` derive's `#[default] OnRead`) instead of the redundant `#[serde(default = "default_auto_pull")]` + free function. Single source of truth for the default lives on the enum itself.
- Extracted `flash::project_geometry` helper (see above).
- Renamed `flash_backend_unknown_value_bails` → `flash_backend_clap_rejects_unknown_variant` to match the new semantic (parse-time clap rejection rather than runtime "unknown" branch).

**Test count: 236** (up from 220 at the end of Phase 2). +16 new tests across the post-review pass: 2 wiremock (oversized body, Retry-After 429), 4 cache/revision corruption regressions, 2 init template content round-trips, 4 flash environment-stub tests, 3 kb_toml validation tests, plus the 1 backoff_grows update for the new RNG. Clippy clean. Fmt clean. `cargo test --workspace` green from a fresh checkout.

### Fixed (Phase 2 of audit cleanup — 67 "important" items across 8 batches)

Phase 2 followed Phase 1's 27-critical-item pass and cleaned up the
"important" tier of audit findings: silent error swallowing still
present in a few corners, HTTP client production-readiness, stringly
-typed config that should be enums, SSoT drift between hardcoded
constants and the schema defaults, lint-rule false positives and
jargon leakage, codegen edge cases, command UX polish, and test
hygiene. Eight batches, review points between, no regressions.

**P2.1 — Silent error cleanup:**
- `pull::read_cache` now distinguishes `NotFound` (silent) from "cache file is corrupt" (`tracing::warn!`). The previous `.ok().unwrap_or_default()` chain made flaky-network reproductions invisible.
- `pull::local_revision_hash` returns `Result<Option<String>>` — parse errors on `pulled/revision.json` propagate with `.context("parsing ...")` instead of looking like "no local hash" and triggering an immediate overwrite.
- `commands::diff` parses historical `features.toml` via `.with_context(...)` instead of `unwrap_or_default`ing a malformed blob into an empty one.
- `build::input_sha` walkdir errors propagate via `with_context` instead of `filter_map(|e| e.ok())`; silent drops would produce a sha that says "inputs stable" while they actually contained unreadable files, leading to false cache hits and stale firmware.
- `lint::rules::process_record_user_collision` surfaces walkdir + read errors as `Severity::Info` issues instead of silently dropping them via `into_iter().flatten()`.
- `generate::rules_mk` walkdir errors propagate with `.with_context(...)`.

**P2.2 — GraphQL client production-readiness:**
- `util::http::client` now splits `connect_timeout = 5s` from `total_timeout = 15s` so a DNS black-hole fails fast without waiting out the full request budget.
- User-Agent header set to `oryx-bench/<crate-version>` so Oryx operators can correlate server-side errors with client versions.
- `reqwest` gzip feature enabled so the full-layout response compresses on the wire when Oryx supports it.
- `MAX_RESPONSE_BYTES = 5 MiB` cap enforced in `pull::graphql::read_capped_body` via `take(MAX+1).read_to_end()`. Prevents OOM from a buggy/malicious server. New `PullError::ResponseTooLarge` variant.
- Bounded retry with exponential backoff + jitter (max 3 attempts, `BACKOFF_BASE = 200ms`) for 502/503/504 and transient connect/timeout errors. GraphQL queries are read-only and idempotent so retrying is safe. Non-retriable failures (500, 4xx) short-circuit.
- `Retry-After` on 429 honored, capped to 60s so a misbehaving server can't hang the CLI for hours. Supports delta-seconds form; HTTP-date form falls back to a short fixed wait.
- New wiremock tests: `pull_now_retries_transient_503_then_succeeds` (retry path), `pull_now_gives_up_after_persistent_503` (exhaustion path), plus 5 unit tests for `parse_retry_after` and `backoff_delay` growth.

**P2.3 — Stringly-typed config → typed enums:**
- `Achordion.chord_strategy: String` → `ChordStrategy::{OppositeHands, Always, Never}` with `#[serde(rename_all = "snake_case")]` + Display. A typo like `"oppositehands"` now fails at `features.toml` parse time with `unknown variant 'oppositehands', expected one of 'opposite_hands', 'always', 'never'`. The previous `match` on `.as_str()` silently fell through to the default for any typo, so the user thought they'd set `"always"` and got opposite-hands resolution instead.
- `Build.backend: String` → `BuildBackend::{Docker, Auto, Native, Nix}`. Same typo-rejection property (`"dockre"` now fails at kb.toml parse). Native and Nix are reserved variants that the dispatcher rejects with a pointer to `docker`, so users can pin them forwards-compatibly.
- `flash --backend: String` → `BackendChoice` clap `ValueEnum` with `Auto`/`Wally`/`Keymapp`. `--backend dfu-util` now fails at argument parse with `[possible values: auto, wally, keymapp]` instead of reaching a runtime "unknown backend" branch. Concrete `Backend` (Wally/Keymapp) kept distinct because `Auto` is not a strategy — it's resolved by `detect_backend`.
- `AutoPull` gained `Default + Display + as_str()`. Used by the init template (P2.4) so the emitted `kb.toml` references the typed default instead of a hardcoded `"on_read"` literal.

**P2.4 — SSoT extractions:**
- `Geometry::usb_vendor_id() -> &'static str` and `flash_budget_bytes() -> u64` added to the trait. Voyager returns `"0x3297"` / `64 * 1024`. `flash::plan` now pulls target name + vendor ID from the trait (no more hardcoded `"0x3297"` in the flash plan); `large_firmware` lint rule pulls the budget from the trait and uses `WARNING_THRESHOLD_FRACTION = 0.9375` instead of a hardcoded `60 * 1024`. Adding a second board now requires zero changes to the flash/lint paths.
- `not_pulled_recently` lint rule reads `ctx.project.cfg.sync.warn_if_stale_s` instead of a hardcoded 7-day constant. Matches the kb.toml schema default (1 day) and respects per-project overrides.
- `kb_toml::DEFAULT_POLL_INTERVAL_S` and `DEFAULT_WARN_IF_STALE_S` made public. `commands::init` kb.toml template interpolates them (plus `BuildBackend::default()` and `AutoPull::default()`) instead of hardcoding `"60"`/`"86400"`/`"docker"`/`"on_read"` literals. Changing the schema default now flows automatically into fresh-init templates.
- `tt_too_short` lint rule split into `TAPPING_TERM_MINIMUM_MS = 150` (threshold at which the rule fires) and `TAPPING_TERM_RECOMMENDED_MS = 180` (what the message says to increase to). Previously the threshold said 150ms but the message recommended ≥180ms without explaining the 30ms buffer.

**P2.5 — Lint rule polish:**
- `unused-feature-flag` now walks *every* enabled flag in `[features]`, not just a hardcoded `key_overrides`/`combos` pair. A user who set `macros = true` with no `[[macros]]` entries previously got a silent empty compile. New `flag_is_unused` lookup table is the single source of truth for which flags have corresponding declarative sections. Non-declarative flags (`mouse_keys`, `rgb_matrix`, etc.) return `None` so they don't fire false positives.
- `custom-keycode-undefined` now honors Tier 2 overlay files: `overlay/*.zig`, `overlay/*.c`, `overlay/*.h` are scanned for `USER<nn>` literal tokens and those slots are treated as "defined" in addition to the `[[macros]]` entries. The previous version falsely errored when a user legitimately dispatched a custom keycode from Zig — exactly the case the rule's own `fix_example` documents as valid. New `extract_user_tokens` helper with word-boundary check (so `MY_USER00` doesn't match) + digit-normalization (so `USER5` is recognized as `USER05`).
- `process-record-user-collision` now has Zig-syntax test coverage: `export fn process_record_user(...)` and its multi-line variant are both detected, `extern fn` declarations correctly ignored. The scanner works for Zig because trimmed lines with `fn process_record_user(` pass the whitespace-prefix check.
- "Path A" jargon removed from 6 lint rule `fix_example` strings (`kc-no-in-overlay`, `home-row-mods-asymmetric`, `layer-name-collision`, `unknown-layer-ref`, `orphaned-mod-tap`, `unreachable-layer`). Each rule's fix text is now self-contained — a user who hasn't read the skill's SKILL.md can act on it. The Path A/Path B vocabulary remains in the skill docs as defined concepts.
- `CanonicalAction` and `LayerRef` now derive `PartialEq, Eq`. Unblocks future equality checks in diff and lint logic.
- `Keycode::KcRgbHuiHue` renamed to `KcRgbHueUp` for naming consistency with its sibling `KcRgbHueDown`. `"RGB_HUI"` and `"RGB_HUE_INCREASE"` still parse to this variant; emit form is unchanged.
- `lint --rule <id>` now validates against `rules::registry()` and bails with the full list of known rule IDs on typo. `lint.ignore` in kb.toml warns (doesn't error) on unknown IDs — a project-wide suppression is usually deliberate but a typo silently un-suppresses the rule, which the old code made invisible.

**P2.6 — Codegen edge cases + emit fallbacks:**
- `escape_c_string` rewritten to handle `\r`, `\0` (NUL — was truncating C literals at compile time), and other ASCII control characters (`<0x20` / `0x7F` as `\xNN`). UTF-8 passes through unchanged. 5 new unit tests pin the behavior.
- `FeaturesToml::tapping_term_ms()` now returns `Result<Option<u32>>` and rejects values outside `1..=65535` with a clear "out of range" error instead of silent `as u32` wrapping. Non-integer values (`tapping_term_ms = "oops"`) error with `must be an integer, got ...`. 5 new unit tests.
- `config_h::emit_config_h` now validates known-typed keys up front via `features.tapping_term_ms()?` so a bad value fails at generation time (with a line pointer) rather than deep inside QMK's compile.
- `keymap::emit_action` and `emit_key` now return `Result<String>`. `resolve_layer` returns `Err` when the layer ref is unknown — previously fell back to the raw user-facing name which would blow up inside QMK with `'Sym+Num' undeclared`. Errors cascade through `emit_keymap_c`, `emit_keymaps_array`, `generate_all`. New tests assert the error paths: `emit_action_unknown_layer_name_errors`, `emit_action_unknown_layer_index_errors`, `emit_action_custom_falls_back_to_user_literal`.
- `CanonicalAction::Custom(n)` fallback changed from `KC_NO /* missing CK for USERnn */` to the QMK-native `USER<nn>` literal. QMK declares these in its `keycodes.h` so Tier 2 overlay code can dispatch on them without needing our generated enum. The previous fallback silently replaced the key with "does nothing" which meant pressing a Tier-2-handled custom keycode produced no feedback.
- `translate_binding` returns `Result` with `.with_context("translating features.toml binding '...'")` so users get the offending binding in the error. Cascaded through `emit_achordion`, `emit_tapping_term_per_key`.
- `rules_mk.rs` module docs no longer claim Zig support — admitting v0.1 reality (Zig files are scanned by lint but not compiled). Full Zig wiring is tracked as a separate task.
- Removed the `_keep_keycode_in_scope` dead helper and its `#[allow(dead_code)]` attribute in `generate/keymap.rs`. Replaced the top-level `use crate::schema::keycode::Keycode` with test-scoped imports.

**P2.7 — Command UX improvements:**
- `commands::diff::git_show` now uses `git cat-file -e` for the existence probe (exit-code signal, locale-independent) and `git cat-file -p` for the read (raw blob, no smudging). The previous implementation matched English strings `"does not exist"` / `"exists on disk"` in `git show`'s stderr, which silently broke under any non-English git i18n.
- `commands::detach` now has explicit rollback: if the kb.toml write fails after layout.toml was written, delete the stray layout.toml so the user sees the same on-disk state they started with. `pulled/` and cache removal errors downgrade to `eprintln!` warnings rather than leaving a half-detached project.
- `render::ascii::truncate_with_ellipsis` — cells wider than 7 chars now show `…` as the last character to signal truncation. The previous renderer silently cut characters off the right edge, making `LT(Sym+Num, KC_BSPC)` and `LT(Sym+Num,` look identical. 4 new unit tests; 5 render snapshots regenerated.
- `skill::install_global` / `remove_global` now use `directories::BaseDirs::home_dir()` instead of `std::env::var_os("HOME")`. Works on Windows (`%USERPROFILE%`), macOS, and Linux. The previous version errored on Windows with "HOME not set".
- `ProjectError::InvalidConfig` no longer double-prints the source error. `{source}` in the format string + `#[source]` attribute was causing anyhow's chain-aware `:#` formatter to print the underlying toml error twice. Comment explains the reasoning.

**P2.8 — Test hygiene:**
- `flash::keymapp` split: `stage` (public, uses `ProjectDirs` cache) and `stage_into(dest_dir)` (lower-level, takes explicit dest). Test rewritten to use two `TempDir`s so it never touches the real user cache — the previous `stage_writes_firmware_to_cache` test wrote into `~/.cache/oryx-bench/firmware.bin` and could clobber a user's actual staged firmware during `cargo test`.
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` no longer references the non-existent `src/render/svg.rs`. The tree diagram and the "SVG rendering shells out to keymap-drawer" paragraph now explicitly mark that code as v0.2+ future work, matching v0.1 reality where only `render::ascii` exists.

**Phase 2 discoveries filed as separate tasks:**
- **FULL_QUERY combos selection mismatch against live Oryx schema** — discovered during P2.3 end-to-end testing. Our GraphQL `FULL_QUERY` requests `combos` as a scalar, but the live Oryx endpoint now returns it as a `Combo` object requiring a sub-selection. Any real pull against `oryx.zsa.io` currently fails with `Field must have selections`. Must fix before v0.1 ships. Tracked as a separate task.
- **Zig Tier 2 end-to-end wiring** — `rules_mk.rs` module docs (P2.6) admitted that Zig files are scanned by lint but never actually compiled. Proper wiring requires updating the docker backend to invoke `zig cc` on each `overlay/*.zig` and appending the resulting `.o` files to QMK's link step. Tracked as v0.2+ work.

**Test count: 220** (up from 180 at the end of Phase 1, up from 169 at the end of the quality-bar pass). `cargo test` green end-to-end. Phase 2 added 40 new unit and integration tests across the 8 batches. Clippy clean. Fmt clean.

### Fixed (Phase 1 of audit cleanup — 27 critical items)

**Codegen compile bugs (would have failed to compile any real project):**
- `enum custom_keycodes` is now emitted in `_features.h` instead of `keymap.c`, so both translation units see the same custom-keycode IDs. The previous arrangement linked-failed any project with `[[macros]]` defining USERnn slots.
- `with_kc_prefix` rewritten as `normalize_keycode_token` that recurses into paren wrappers. The fixture's `S(GRAVE)` key override now correctly emits `S(KC_GRAVE)` instead of the broken `S(GRAVE)`.
- `mods_to_qmk` validates modifier tokens against the QMK accept set; typos like `LSHF` are rejected at codegen time.
- `emit_combos` now returns `Result` and errors loudly on unknown layer / unknown position / unbound keycode instead of silently writing `// skipped` comments into the C source.
- The codegen layer is now the *single* owner of every file the build pipeline stages. Removed the `FEATURES_HEADER` constant from `build/docker.rs` — `_features.h` is generated by `features::emit_features_h`.

**Data-loss safety gaps:**
- `git::has_uncommitted_changes` is gone. Replaced with `git::working_tree_state` returning `Clean | Dirty | NotARepo` and propagating real errors. `attach` now refuses to touch a non-git directory without `--force` (the previous fail-open behavior could silently delete `layout.toml`).
- `attach` reordered: pull happens *first* into `.oryx-bench/build/attach-staging/`. Only after the pull succeeds is the staged `revision.json` swapped into the real `pulled/`, kb.toml replaced, and `layout.toml` removed. A failed pull now leaves the project fully intact instead of half-attached.
- `render_layout_toml` returns `anyhow::Result<String>` instead of a literal `"# unknown geometry — could not render\n"` placeholder. `detach` now errors cleanly when the geometry is unknown instead of writing the error string as a real layout.toml and then deleting `pulled/`.
- `detach` cleans up the auto-pull cache via `with_context` propagation instead of `let _ = remove_file(...)`.

**Stale milestone scaffolding leaking to user output:**
- Removed `(M2)`, `(M3)` parentheticals from clap help text — they were visible in `oryx-bench --help`.
- Removed "Implemented in task #6" / "task #8" docstring leaks from `cli.rs` and `xtask/src/main.rs`.
- `render/mod.rs` no longer says "M2+" for SVG.
- `build/mod.rs` says "not supported in v0.1" instead of "M5+ work".
- `util/toolchain.rs` says "future native backend" instead of "v0.2+".

**Lying flags removed:**
- `build --release` parsed-and-ignored flag deleted.
- `flash --no-pull` no-op flag deleted (replaced with `flash --force` for the actually-meaningful "skip the freshness check" semantics).
- `setup --full` now actually invokes each detected tool with its appropriate version flag (`--version` / `version`) and surfaces the output. Previously toggled only the description-string rendering.

**Dead config fields:**
- Removed `Build.qmk_pin`, `Build.zig_pin`, `Build.qmk_branch` (legacy alias), `Flash.backend`, `Flash.dry_run`, `Render.default_layer`, `Skill.auto_install` from `kb.toml` schema — every one was parsed but never read by any consumer. The example fixture and the init scaffold templates updated to match. A user setting `[flash] backend = "wally"` in kb.toml will now get a parse error (the field doesn't exist) instead of silent indifference.

**Crash-safety + concurrency:**
- `util::fs::atomic_write` is now actually crash-atomic: adds `tmp.as_file().sync_all()` to flush the kernel page cache before persist, and `dir.sync_all()` on the parent after rename so the directory entry is durable. The "Safe across power loss" docstring is now true.
- `util::lock::ProjectLock` provides advisory file locks via `fs2::FileExt::try_lock_exclusive`. `build::docker::build` takes an exclusive lock on `.oryx-bench/build/build.lock` for the entire build, so two concurrent `oryx-bench build` instances against the same project can't corrupt the staged keymap dir or the cache file.
- `xtask gen-skill-docs` now uses an atomic-write helper (sync + rename) so a killed regen never leaves a partial markdown file in the skills tree.
- Docker invocation passes `--user $UID:$GID` on Unix so produced files are owned by the invoking user, not root.
- The spurious `zsa_voyager_oryx-bench.bin` left in the project root by `qmk compile` is now staged into `.oryx-bench/build/firmware.bin` and removed from the project root, so the user's git tree stays clean.

**Multi-mod combo support:**
- New `CanonicalAction::Modified { mods, base }` variant. Oryx serializes "send X with Ctrl+Shift held" as a regular `tap` action with a non-null `modifiers` field listing which mods to wrap. Previously dropped silently — `keys[45]` in the fixture's `Brd+Sys` layer was a `KC_TAB` with `LCTL+LSFT` that emitted just `KC_TAB`. Now correctly renders as `LCTL(LSFT(KC_TAB))` in the generated C and the ASCII grid. New parser handles both Oryx's object form (`{leftCtrl: true, leftShift: true}`) and the older array form (`["LCTL", "LSFT"]`).

**`flash` build-freshness check:**
- New `flash --force` flag. Without it, `flash` re-derives the input sha (canonical layout + features.toml + overlay/) and refuses to flash if the build cache's recorded sha differs. Previously you could `oryx-bench pull && oryx-bench flash` and silently flash the *old* firmware against the *new* layout.

**Cargo cleanup:**
- Removed `time` and `proptest` from `Cargo.toml` — both unused.
- Added `fs2 = "0.4"` for advisory file locking.
- Bumped flake.nix to actually build the binary via `rustPlatform.buildRustPackage` (was `pkgs.hello`). `nix build` now produces `oryx-bench`. Version derived from `Cargo.toml` so there's a single source of truth.

**Doc drift cleanup:**
- `README.md` top banner no longer says "design phase, v0.0.0" — now correctly states v0.1.0 status with what's shipped vs deferred.
- README's command table updated from "13 commands" to 15 (added `diff`, `upgrade-check`, expanded existing entries with their new flags).
- README's Roadmap section rewritten — no more M1-M4 milestone columns, just "v0.1 (current)" and "future releases".
- README's "Install (planned for v0.1)" section replaced with actual install instructions (`cargo install`, `nix run`, source build).
- ARCHITECTURE.md top banner updated; the M1-M4 milestone column in the command table replaced with a flat list.
- ARCHITECTURE.md `M5+` / `v0.2+` / `M4 work` annotations removed throughout (10+ sites).
- `skills/oryx-bench/SKILL.md` description updated to acknowledge Voyager-only support; commands list now includes `upgrade-check` and `setup --full`.
- `voyager.rs` module docstring updated to use the column-first naming vocabulary.
- `examples/voyager-dvorak/kb.toml` no longer references the dead `qmk_branch` / `flash.backend` / `render.default_layer` fields.

**Other quality improvements:**
- `lint::run_all` now propagates `features.toml` parse errors instead of `unwrap_or_default`-ing a malformed file into an empty one.
- `lint::oryx_newer_than_build` rule rewritten as a real implementation (was a no-op stub) — re-derives the current input sha and compares against `.oryx-bench/build/build.sha`.
- Removed the dead `config-redefine-without-undef` lint rule (its property is now structurally impossible to violate, so the rule was dead code by design). Registry is now 21 rules.
- `flash::sha256_of_file` extracted as the single source of truth for firmware hashing — both `flash::plan` and `build::docker::build` use it so the hash format never drifts.
- Compile-time `const _: ()` assertion in `skill::embedded` ensures none of the bundled markdown files are empty (replaces the runtime `ensure_bundled_in_binary()` dead-call).
- `util::term::{OK, WARN, HINT}` applied consistently — removed the last inline `✓`/`⚠`/`—` literals from `commands::status` and `util::toolchain`.

**Test count: 180 (up from 169). Clippy clean. Fmt clean. End-to-end smoke test against the fixture passes.**

### Fixed (quality bar pass — zero "fix later" TODOs, zero silent error swallowing)

- **Removed `--svg` placeholder flag from `oryx-bench show`.** Was bailing with `"--svg output is M2 work"` while exposed in clap. Faking functionality violates the bar; the flag returns when keymap-drawer is actually wired up.
- **Removed `config-redefine-without-undef` lint rule.** Was a structurally dead no-op stub: the generator's `#undef`-then-`#define` pair makes the property the rule was meant to catch impossible to violate. Dead code violates SSoT. Now down to 21 lint rules.
- **Implemented `oryx-newer-than-build` lint rule properly** (was a no-op stub). Re-derives the current input sha from canonical layout + features.toml + overlay/, compares against `.oryx-bench/build/build.sha`, fires when they differ.
- **`lint::run_all` now propagates parse errors** instead of silently `unwrap_or_default`ing a malformed `features.toml` into an empty one. Lint surface broken overlay configs immediately. Updated all callers (`commands::lint`/`status`/`find`/`explain`/`upgrade_check`) to handle the Result.
- **Auto-pull failures now surface as warnings** in `commands::show`/`build`/`lint` instead of silently being swallowed via `let _ = pull::auto_pull(...)`. Users see `warning: auto-pull failed: ...` and the read still proceeds.
- **Pull cache write failures now `tracing::warn!`** instead of `let _ = write_cache(...)`. Cache writes are best-effort but failures are surfaced.
- **`Docker IMAGE_TAG` now derives from `CARGO_PKG_VERSION`** at compile time (`concat!("ghcr.io/.../oryx-bench-qmk:v", env!("CARGO_PKG_VERSION"))`). Was hardcoded to the stale `v0.0.0`.
- **`_features.h` no longer says "minimal stub"** in a comment. Replaced with a proper SPDX-headered file generated through a `FEATURES_HEADER` constant. Documents that future generator-emitted public symbols land here.
- **Magic numbers replaced with named constants**: `ACHORDION_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_MS = 800`, `QMK_DEFAULT_TAPPING_TERM_MS = 200`, `TAPPING_TERM_MINIMUM_MS = 150`, `HTTP_TIMEOUT = 15s`. The Voyager flash budget constants were already named.
- **`flash::keymapp::cache_dir` no longer falls back to `cwd/.oryx-bench-cache`** when `ProjectDirs` returns None. Errors cleanly with a useful message pointing the user at `--backend wally` or directly opening Keymapp against the project's `.oryx-bench/build/firmware.bin`.
- **Cross-platform Unicode**: new `util::term` module wraps `console::Emoji` with `OK`, `WARN`, `HINT` constants that fall back to `[OK]`/`[!]`/`[hint]` on legacy terminals. Replaced 16 inline `✓`/`⚠`/`💡` literals across `init`, `pull`, `attach`, `detach`, `build`, `flash`, `lint`, `skill`, `upgrade_check`, `explain`, `flash::keymapp` with the helper.
- **`util::fs::atomic_write`** now propagates the tempfile flush error instead of `.ok()`-ing it. File writes are crash-safe end-to-end.
- **Removed dead `let _ = skill::embedded::ensure_bundled_in_binary()`** call in `init.rs`. Replaced with a `const _: ()` compile-time assertion in `skill::embedded` that fails the build if any embedded skill file is empty — same property, surfaces at compile time, and the dead-call site is gone.
- **`commands::detach` cache cleanup now propagates errors** (was `let _ = std::fs::remove_file(&cache)`).
- **Wording cleanup**: `build/mod.rs` says "not supported in v0.1" instead of "M5+ work"; `util/toolchain.rs` says "future native backend" instead of "v0.2+"; `commands/upgrade_check.rs` removed the "v0.2 work" comment (the snapshot diffing feature is documented in the module docstring as a planned future addition, not as a TODO masking a bug).
- **`tests/codegen_roundtrip.rs` rewritten** to actually do the round-trip. The previous version "explicitly deferred steps 4-7" — that was a fix-later TODO. New version: parses every `LAYOUT_voyager(...)` block out of the generated source, walks each positional arg through the QMK arg-order permutation back to a canonical index, and asserts the canonical key at that index renders to the exact string the generator emitted. Catches the entire class of off-by-N permutation / dropped-hold / wrong-layer-name codegen bugs deterministically, with zero external tools. The optional `qmk c2json` integration test still runs when `qmk` is on PATH.
- **`ARCHITECTURE.md` `layout.toml` example updated** from the obsolete `L_pinky_num`/`L_inner2_top` vocabulary to the column-first `L_outer_num`/`L_inner_top` vocabulary that matches the implementation. The "position names are stable" paragraph now documents the column-first naming explicitly.

**Test count: 169 (up from 164). Clippy clean. Fmt clean. `cargo test --workspace` green from a fresh checkout.**

### Fixed (second post-review correctness pass — TWO release-blocking bugs)

The second review pass caught two release-blocking bugs in the cumulative v0.1 surface; both fixed:

1. **Voyager `POSITION_TABLE` had right-half indices off by 2 and the left thumb cluster pointed at the wrong indices entirely.** Oryx serializes the `keys[]` array as `[left rows 0..24][left thumb 24..26][right rows 26..50][right thumb 50..52]`, but my table treated indices 24-29 as right top row (actually left thumb + first 4 right top keys) and 48-49 as left thumb (actually the rightmost right bottom keys). User-visible: `oryx-bench show` rendered `KC_SPC, KC_CAPS` in the right top row (those are left thumb keys); `oryx-bench find position:R_index_home` returned the wrong key; the `home_row_mods_asymmetric` lint counted the wrong half. Verified the fix end-to-end: Main layer now correctly shows SPC + CAPS in the left thumb cluster and ENTER/BSPC in the right thumb cluster.

2. **Codegen `emit_keymaps_array` iterated keys in Oryx serialization order and emitted them positionally to `LAYOUT_voyager(...)`, which expects a different physical-interleaved order.** QMK's `LAYOUT_voyager` macro takes 52 args in `[L row 0][R row 0][L row 1][R row 1]...[L thumb][R thumb]` order; Oryx serializes left rows then left thumb then right rows then right thumb. Without permutation, every right-side key in the generated `keymap.c` ended up at the wrong physical position — **flashing the firmware would produce a visibly broken layout**. Added `Geometry::qmk_arg_order()` returning a 52-element permutation table, derived from the upstream `keyboard.json` for `keyboards/zsa/voyager` in the firmware24 ZSA QMK fork. Updated `emit_keymaps_array` to walk the permutation. Two new tests pin the permutation: `qmk_arg_order_is_a_complete_permutation` (every canonical index appears exactly once) and `qmk_arg_order_pins_known_positions` (specific anchor points: `QMK[0..6] = canonical 0..6`, `QMK[6..12] = canonical 26..32`, `QMK[48..50] = canonical 24..26`, etc.). End-to-end smoke test: `build --emit-overlay-c` against the fixture now produces a `keymap.c` with each row correctly emitting `[L 6 keys][R 6 keys]` and the thumb row as `[L inner][L outer][R inner][R outer]`.

Plus the secondary reviewer findings:

- Bumped `Cargo.toml` to `version = "0.1.0"`.
- Removed the `_sanitize_c_ident_reexport` leading-underscore re-export.
- Tightened `flash_smoke::flash_without_yes_and_with_no_stdin_bails_safely` to assert `Aborted` is in stdout (was permissive).
- `flash::confirm` now case-insensitive via `eq_ignore_ascii_case` (accepts `Yes`/`yEs`/etc).
- `oryx_combo_to_canonical` emits a `tracing::warn!` instead of silently dropping unknown combo shapes.
- Fixed misleading comment at `tests/lint_rules.rs:220` (was `L_pinky_home`, now correctly `L_outer_home` under the column-first naming).
- Replaced the no-op `fixture_home_row_mods_asymmetric_does_not_falsely_fire` test with a real assertion: the fixture has mods on both halves so the rule should NOT fire — verified.
- Fixed `examples/voyager-dvorak/overlay/features.toml` position-name comment from `L_pinky_num` to `L_outer_num`.
- Added 4 new `GeometryName` round-trip tests (Voyager + Other variants through serde, plus `from_str` parsing).

**Test count: 164 (up from 162). Clippy clean. Fmt clean.**

### Added (M4 implementation)

- **`oryx-bench diff [REF] [--layer NAME]`** — semantic diff vs a git ref:
  - Shells out to `git show <ref>:<path>` for both `pulled/revision.json` (Oryx mode) or `layout.toml` (local mode), parses both into `CanonicalLayout`, walks position-by-position and prints every changed binding (`Layer Position: old → new`).
  - Diffs `overlay/features.toml` separately: changed `[config]` keys, added/removed `[[key_overrides]]`/`[[macros]]`/`[[combos]]`/`[[tapping_term_per_key]]` entries, achordion enabled/strategy/timeout-count changes.
  - `--layer` filters the visual diff to one layer.
  - Bails cleanly if `git` is not on PATH or the file doesn't exist at the given ref.
- **`oryx-bench upgrade-check`** — re-lint after a tool upgrade:
  - Walks the layout looking for `Keycode::Other` instances (uncatalogued keycodes) and surfaces them per layer/position.
  - Re-runs the full lint registry and prints error/warning/info counts.
  - Lists every registered lint rule with its severity and description so users can see what's new since their last release.
  - Snapshot diffing against a `.oryx-bench/upgrade.json` is deferred to v0.2.
- **3 new lint rules** (registry now has 22):
  - `unused-feature-flag` (info) — `[features]` enables `key_overrides`/`combos` but the corresponding section is empty (wastes flash).
  - `large-firmware` (info) — info if `.oryx-bench/build/firmware.bin` is ≥60KB (93.75% of the Voyager's ~64KB budget).
  - `unbound-tapping-term` (warning) — `[[tapping_term_per_key]]` references a binding that doesn't exist anywhere in the layout (dead switch case).
- **5 new lint rule tests** in `tests/lint_rules.rs` (positive + negative coverage for the new rules).

**Test count: 157 (up from 151), all green. Clippy clean. Fmt clean.**

### Added (M3 implementation)

- **`src/flash/`** — flash backends + dispatcher:
  - `wally.rs`: invokes `wally-cli <firmware.bin>` directly when on PATH.
  - `keymapp.rs`: fallback handoff. Stages the firmware at `~/.cache/oryx-bench/firmware.bin` (via `directories::ProjectDirs`) and prints platform-specific Keymapp instructions for Linux / macOS / Windows.
  - `mod.rs`: backend detection (`auto`/`wally`/`keymapp`), `FlashPlan` type with size + sha256 + target metadata, `render_plan` for `--dry-run`, `execute` for the irreversible step.
  - **Never invokes `dfu-util`** — reflected in the keymapp instructions and the docs.
- **`src/commands/flash.rs`** — fully implemented:
  - `--dry-run` prints the flash plan and exits 0 without touching hardware.
  - `--yes` skips the in-process `[y/N]` confirmation prompt (still requires conversational approval when used by an agent).
  - `--backend auto|wally|keymapp` selects the backend explicitly.
  - `--no-pull` is a no-op — flash never auto-pulls per spec (the moment of commitment).
  - Bails cleanly with "run `oryx-bench build` first" if no firmware exists.
  - Handles EOF on stdin gracefully (treats as "no" rather than hanging).
- **`tests/flash_smoke.rs`** — 5 integration tests covering: dry-run output, missing-firmware error path, explicit backend selection, unknown-backend error, and EOF-stdin abort safety. All run without real hardware.

**Test count: 151 (up from 146), all green. Clippy clean. Fmt clean.**

### Fixed (post-review correctness pass)

Reviewer agent caught seven critical correctness gaps in M1+M2; all addressed:

- **Mod-tap canonical conversion**: `oryx_action_to_canonical` now collapses `tap=Keycode + hold=Modifier` into `ModTap`, mirroring the existing `LT` collapse. Without this, every lint rule that reasoned about mod-taps (`mod-tap-on-vowel`, `home-row-mods-asymmetric`, `tt-too-short`) silently never fired on real Oryx layouts.
- **`emit_key` defensive collapse**: keymap.rs now synthesizes `LT`/`ModTap` from any tap+hold pair the canonical pass missed, so `hold` is never silently dropped.
- **USER custom keycode parsing**: both `oryx_action_to_canonical` and `layout::parse_action` now recognize `USERnn` slots and produce `CanonicalAction::Custom(n)`. The two custom-keycode lint rules now reach real projects.
- **Typed `GeometryName` enum**: `CanonicalLayout.geometry` is now a typed enum (`Voyager`/`Other(String)`), per spec at ARCHITECTURE.md:581. `From<&str>` impl preserves ergonomics.
- **Combos in `CanonicalLayout` + `FULL_QUERY`**: added `CanonicalCombo` type and `combos: Vec<CanonicalCombo>` field. `FULL_QUERY` now requests `combos` and `swatch` from Oryx. Best-effort projection from the `oryx::Combo` extras bag.
- **Voyager `POSITION_TABLE` dual-vocabulary fix**: collapsed the inconsistent `L_pinky_*`/`L_pinky_q`/`L_pinky_h` mix into a single column-first naming scheme: `outer/pinky/ring/middle/index/inner` × `num/top/home/bottom`. Each of the 52 indices now has exactly one canonical name.
- **`layout.toml` `inherit = "<layer>"` semantics**: overlay layers in local mode now correctly default unspecified positions to `KC_TRNS` (transparent fall-through), not `KC_NO`. Spec at ARCHITECTURE.md:1199.

Additional important fixes from the same review:

- **`config.h` boolean QMK macros**: maintain an allow-list of define-only toggles (`PERMISSIVE_HOLD`, `HOLD_ON_OTHER_KEY_PRESS`, `RETRO_TAPPING`, `TAPPING_FORCE_HOLD`, `CHORDAL_HOLD`, etc.). `true` emits a bare `#define`, `false` emits nothing — the previous behavior of `#define PERMISSIVE_HOLD false` actually *enabled* the feature.
- **`unknown-keycode` severity**: lowered from Error to Warning to honor the forward-compat invariant. `Keycode::Other(_)` is the catch-all and codegen emits it verbatim; lint shouldn't block real layouts that use catalogued-but-not-yet-known keycodes like `RGB_SLD`.
- **`sanitize_c_ident` relocation**: moved from `lint::rules::layer_name_collision` to a new `schema::naming` module. Codegen no longer imports from lint.
- **`KC_LCTL` dual encoding**: `references_keycode` now matches both `Keycode(KcLctl)` and `Modifier(Lctl)` representations. Also normalizes bare keycode queries (`BSPC` → `KC_BSPC`).
- **`process_record_user_collision` heuristic**: rewrote with a state-machine that distinguishes function definitions from declarations and call-sites. Strips block comments. Tested against 7 positive/negative cases.
- **`home-row-mods-asymmetric`**: now checks both `tap` and `hold` slots (orphaned mod-taps live on `hold`).
- **`status` always queries metadata**: `check_metadata_only` no longer short-circuits via cache age; the spec requires `status` to always do the cheap GraphQL metadata query.
- **`pull` cache backoff on failure**: failed metadata queries now update `last_check_epoch` so a flaky network doesn't hammer Oryx on every read command.
- **`find` lowercase + bare-letter support**: `find a`, `find kc_bspc` now normalize and resolve correctly.
- **Init scaffold cleanup**: removed `pulled/.gitkeep` from Oryx mode; local-mode `layout.toml` scaffold uses dotted-key syntax with commented examples.
- **RGB long-form keycodes**: added `RGB_MODE_FORWARD`/`RGB_HUE_INCREASE`/etc. as aliases.

New tests:

- `tests/lint_rules.rs` — 6 fixture-based tests against the real voyager-dvorak fixture covering `lt-on-high-freq`, `overlay-dangling-keycode`, `overlay-dangling-position`, `unknown-layer-ref`, `orphaned-mod-tap`, `home-row-mods-asymmetric`. These catch any future schema change that breaks lint rule preconditions.
- Mod-tap collapse + USER keycode round-trip tests in `src/schema/canonical.rs`.
- `process_record_user_collision` heuristic: 7 unit tests for definition/declaration/call-site/comment classification.
- `config.h` boolean macro: 3 tests for true/false/non-boolean emission.

**Test count: 146 (up from 127), all green. `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` clean. `cargo fmt --check` clean.**

### Added (M2 implementation)

- Codegen layer (`src/generate/`):
  - `keymap.rs` — emits `keymap.c` with `LAYOUT_voyager(...)` arrays, `enum layers`, `enum custom_keycodes`, and resolves layer references through the sanitized C-ident table.
  - `features.rs` — emits `_features.c` with the `process_record_user` dispatch (chains to `process_record_user_overlay` for Tier 2 hooks), key-override tables (`ko_make_basic`), and per-key tapping term overrides.
  - `config_h.rs` — emits `config.h` with `#undef`/`#define` pairs from `[config]` section.
  - `rules_mk.rs` — emits `rules.mk` with `KEY_OVERRIDE_ENABLE` etc. from `[features]` and walks `overlay/*.c` for `SRC +=` entries.
- Build backend (`src/build/`):
  - `docker.rs` — invokes the bundled `ghcr.io/enriquefft/oryx-bench-qmk:<tag>` image, stages generated files, runs `qmk compile -kb zsa/voyager`, copies the produced `.bin` to `.oryx-bench/build/firmware.bin`. Caches by sha256 of all inputs.
  - Backend dispatcher refuses `native` and `nix` with a clear "M5+ work" message.
- M2 commands fully implemented:
  - `attach --hash <H>` — local mode → Oryx mode, refuses on uncommitted `layout.toml` changes unless `--force`, runs initial pull.
  - `detach` — Oryx mode → local mode (one-way). Renders `pulled/revision.json` back to `layout.toml` via the new `schema/layout::render_layout_toml` writer, removes `pulled/` and the auto-pull cache.
  - `build` — runs the generators + dispatches to the backend, supports `--dry-run`, `--release`, `--emit-overlay-c`, `--no-pull`.
- `util/git.rs` — minimal `has_uncommitted_changes` shell-out (no `git2` dep).
- Tests added:
  - `tests/codegen_roundtrip.rs` — 3 tests: structural sanity on the fixture (4 LAYOUT blocks, LT(SYM_NUM, KC_BSPC) present), features.toml→C output checks, and a `qmk c2json` round-trip that skips gracefully if `qmk` is not on PATH.
  - `tests/attach_detach.rs` — 3 wiremock-backed tests covering attach pulling on first call, detach round-tripping a pulled fixture into `layout.toml`, and detach without `--force` warning only.

### Added (M1 implementation)

- Rust workspace + `xtask` crate scaffolded per ARCHITECTURE.md.
- `flake.nix` + `.envrc` devshell (rustc/cargo/clippy/rustfmt + zig + Python for `qmk`).
- Schema layer (`src/schema/`):
  - `oryx.rs` — GraphQL JSON types with lossless `extra: HashMap` forward-compat.
  - `canonical.rs` — internal `CanonicalLayout` both Oryx and local modes deserialize into, with LT-collapsing normalization.
  - `keycode.rs` — ~190 variant keycode catalog + `Other(String)` catch-all, long/short form round-trip, hand-rolled serde impls.
  - `kb_toml.rs`, `features.rs`, `layout.rs` — project config, overlay features, local-mode layout schemas.
  - `geometry/` — `Geometry` trait + `Voyager` implementation (52 matrix keys, 0 encoders, 4 thumb keys, position name vocabulary).
- Pull layer (`src/pull/`):
  - Blocking reqwest-based GraphQL client with metadata-only + full-layout queries.
  - Auto-pull cache at `.oryx-bench/cache.json` with configurable `poll_interval_s`.
- Hand-rolled ASCII split-grid renderer (`src/render/ascii.rs`).
- Lint layer with 19 registered rules (`src/lint/rules/`):
  - Visual-layout: `lt-on-high-freq`, `unreachable-layer`, `kc-no-in-overlay`, `orphaned-mod-tap`, `unknown-keycode`, `unknown-layer-ref`, `duplicate-action`, `mod-tap-on-vowel`, `home-row-mods-asymmetric`, `layer-name-collision`.
  - Cross-tier: `overlay-dangling-position`, `overlay-dangling-keycode`, `custom-keycode-undefined`, `unreferenced-custom-keycode`, `process-record-user-collision`, `config-redefine-without-undef`.
  - Build/sync state: `tt-too-short`, `not-pulled-recently`, `oryx-newer-than-build` (latter two M2-completed).
- M1 commands (`src/commands/`):
  - `setup`, `init` (both Oryx and local modes), `pull`, `show`, `explain`, `find`, `lint`, `status`, `skill install/remove`.
  - `attach`/`detach`/`build`/`flash`/`diff` stubbed with "M2/M3/M4 work — not implemented in M1" messages.
- Embedded Claude Code skill installer (`src/skill/`) with `include_str!`-bundled files, project-local default install.
- `xtask gen-skill-docs` regenerates `skills/oryx-bench/reference/{lint-rules,command-reference}.md` from the live registries.
- Tests (83 total, all green):
  - Library unit tests (52) covering schemas, keycode parsing, geometry, auto-pull cache, project discovery, atomic writes, skill install, features round-trip.
  - `tests/lint_rules.rs` (21) — positive + negative per rule against the voyager-dvorak fixture.
  - `tests/cli_smoke.rs` (7) — end-to-end init → show → lint → skill install.
  - `tests/skill_drift.rs` (3) — asserts embedded skill files match disk and the generated markdown matches the committed files.
- `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` and `cargo fmt --check` both pass.

### Design

- Initial design committed in `ARCHITECTURE.md`.
- Adopted the **four-tier authoring model**:
  - Tier 0: Oryx UI (visual layout)
  - Tier 1: `overlay/features.toml` (declarative QMK features)
  - Tier 2: `overlay/*.zig` (procedural code, type-safe)
  - Tier 2′: `overlay/*.c` (vendored upstream C libraries)
- Adopted **two visual layout sources** with explicit migration commands:
  - `pulled/revision.json` (Oryx mode, default for Oryx users)
  - `layout.toml` (local mode, no Oryx dependency)
  - `oryx-bench attach` / `oryx-bench detach` for one-time migration
  - Detach is **one-way** — no public Oryx write API
- Adopted **auto-pull on read commands** (default `on_read` with 60s cache)
  so personas using Oryx have zero manual sync ceremony.
- **Verified Zig + QMK link end-to-end**: `@cImport` of QMK headers works,
  `KC_BSPC` resolves correctly, the resulting Zig `.o` links cleanly into
  a real Voyager firmware. See `ARCHITECTURE.md#verification-log`.
- **Cut from v0.1**: native and Nix build backends. Docker is the v0.1
  build path; native and Nix come back in v0.2.
- Cross-tier lint rules added to the spec (catches dangling references
  between `pulled/`, `layout.toml`, and `overlay/`).
- Skill files install **project-local by default** to avoid polluting the
  context budget of unrelated Claude Code sessions.
- Skill reference files for lint rules and command help are **generated by
  an `xtask` binary** (not `build.rs`) so they cannot drift from the
  source they describe.
